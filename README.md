# Flutter Arabic Font

A Flutter package allows you to add arabic fonts in your flutter projects

## Setup

Pubspec changes:

   ```
   dependencies:
        arabic_font: <last_version>
   ```

## Getting Started:

Sample example:

   ```
   import 'package:arabic_font/arabic_font.dart';
const Text(
'تجربة الخط',
style: ArabicTextStyle(arabicFont: ArabicFont.dubai,fontSize:25),
);
   ```

### What You can Do:

1. Change the font for specific text

2. Change the font in the entire application

### To Change the font for specific text:

   ```
   import 'package:arabic_font/arabic_font.dart';

 Text(
'تجربة الخط',

/// Add ArabicTextStyle in style of text 
style: ArabicTextStyle(
/// Select The type of font by useing ArabicFont
arabicFont: ArabicFont.dubai,
/// you can use any Parameters of TextStyle 
/// EX: fontSize:
fontSize:25
),

);
   ```

### To Change the font in the entire application: 

   ```
   import 'package:arabic_font/arabic_font.dart';
ThemeData(
///Add this Class in your ThemeData after fontFamily
fontFamily: ArabicThemeData.font(
/// Select The type of font
arabicFont: ArabicFont.dinNextLTArabic
),

///Add this Class in your ThemeData after package
package: ArabicThemeData.package,

),
   ```

### Parameters of the ArabicTextStyle:

   ```
   /// Use ArabicFont  then select type of font
    /// EX: ArabicFont.dubai
  final String arabicFont;

/// TextStyle Parameters
    bool inherit = true, 
    
    /// the color of text
    Color? color,  
    
    
            /// The color to use as the background for the text.
   /// If background is specified, this value must be null. The backgroundColor property is shorthand for background: Paint()..color = backgroundColor.
  ///  In merge, apply, and lerp, conflicts between backgroundColor and background specification are resolved in background's favor - i.e. if background is specified in one place, it will dominate color in another.
    
    Color? backgroundColor, 
    
   
    ///The size of glyphs (in logical pixels) to use when painting the text.
    ///During painting, the fontSize is multiplied by the current textScaleFactor to let users make it easier to read text by increasing its size.
   /// getParagraphStyle will default to 14 logical pixels if the font size isn't specified here.
   double? fontSize,

    /// The typeface thickness to use when painting the text (e.g., bold).

    FontWeight? fontWeight,
    
    /// The typeface variant to use when drawing the letters (e.g., italics).

            FontStyle? fontStyle,

    /// The amount of space (in logical pixels) to add between each letter.
    /// A negative value can be used to bring the letters closer.
    double? letterSpacing,

    /// The amount of space (in logical pixels) to add at each sequence of
    /// white-space (i.e. between each word). A negative value can be used to
    /// bring the words closer.
            double? wordSpacing,

    /// The common baseline that should be aligned between this text span and its
    /// parent text span, or, for the root text spans, with the line box.
    
    TextBaseline? textBaseline,

    /// The height of this text span, as a multiple of the font size.
    ///
    /// When [height] is null or omitted, the line height will be determined
    /// by the font's metrics directly, which may differ from the fontSize.
    /// When [height] is non-null, the line height of the span of text will be a
    /// multiple of [fontSize] and be exactly `fontSize * height` logical pixels
    /// tall.
    ///
    /// For most fonts, setting [height] to 1.0 is not the same as omitting or
    /// setting height to null because the [fontSize] sets the height of the EM-square,
    /// which is different than the font provided metrics for line height. The
    /// following diagram illustrates the difference between the font-metrics
    /// defined line height and the line height produced with `height: 1.0`
    /// (which forms the upper and lower edges of the EM-square):
    ///
    /// ![With the font-metrics-defined line height, there is space between lines appropriate for the font, whereas the EM-square is only the height required to hold most of the characters.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_diagram.png)
    ///
    /// Examples of the resulting line heights from different values of `TextStyle.height`:
    ///
    /// ![Since the explicit line height is applied as a scale factor on the font-metrics-defined line height, the gap above the text grows faster, as the height grows, than the gap below the text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_comparison_diagram.png)
    ///
    /// See [StrutStyle] and [TextHeightBehavior] for further control of line
    /// height at the paragraph level.
            double? height,

    /// How the vertical space added by the [height] multiplier should be
    /// distributed over and under the text.
    ///
    /// When a non-null [height] is specified, after accommodating the glyphs of
    /// the text, the remaining vertical space from the allotted line height will
    /// be distributed over and under the text, according to the
    /// [leadingDistribution] property. See the [TextStyle] class's documentation
    /// for an example.
    ///
    /// When [height] is null, [leadingDistribution] does not affect the text
    /// layout.
    ///
    /// Defaults to null, which defers to the paragraph's
    /// `ParagraphStyle.textHeightBehavior`'s [leadingDistribution].
    /// 
    TextLeadingDistribution? leadingDistribution,

    /// The locale used to select region-specific glyphs.
    ///
    /// This property is rarely set. Typically the locale used to select
    /// region-specific glyphs is defined by the text widget's [BuildContext]
    /// using `Localizations.localeOf(context)`. For example [RichText] defines
    /// its locale this way. However, a rich text widget's [TextSpan]s could
    /// specify text styles with different explicit locales in order to select
    /// different region-specific glyphs for each text span.
            Locale? locale,

    /// The paint drawn as a foreground for the text.
    ///
    /// The value should ideally be cached and reused each time if multiple text
    /// styles are created with the same paint settings. Otherwise, each time it
    /// will appear like the style changed, which will result in unnecessary

    ///
    /// If [color] is specified, this value must be null. The [color] property
    /// is shorthand for `Paint()..color = color`.
    ///
    /// In [merge], [apply], and [lerp], conflicts between [color] and [foreground]
    /// specification are resolved in [foreground]'s favor - i.e. if [foreground] is
    /// specified in one place, it will dominate [color] in another.
    Paint? foreground,

    /// The paint drawn as a background for the text.
    ///
    /// The value should ideally be cached and reused each time if multiple text
    /// styles are created with the same paint settings. Otherwise, each time it
    /// will appear like the style changed, which will result in unnecessary

            Paint? background,


    /// A list of [Shadow]s that will be painted underneath the text.
    ///
    /// Multiple shadows are supported to replicate lighting from multiple light

    List<FontVariation>? fontVariations,

    /// The decorations to paint near the text (e.g., an underline).

    /// Multiple decorations can be applied using [TextDecoration.combine].
            TextDecoration? decoration,

    Color? decorationColor,

    /// The style in which to paint the text decorations (e.g., dashed).

            TextDecorationStyle? decorationStyle,

    /// The thickness of the decoration stroke as a multiplier of the thickness
    /// defined by the font.
    ///
    /// The font provides a base stroke width for [decoration]s which scales off
    /// of the [fontSize]. This property may be used to achieve a thinner or
    /// thicker decoration stroke, without changing the [fontSize]. For example,
    /// a [decorationThickness] of 2.0 will draw a decoration twice as thick as
    /// the font defined decoration thickness.
    ///
    /// {@tool snippet}
    /// To achieve a bolded strike-through, we can apply a thicker stroke for the
